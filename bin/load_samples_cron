=head1 SYNOPSIS

Set up cron:

 # set up the PERL5LIB and HICF_SCRIPT_CONFIG environment variables to
 # configure the script
 PERL5LIB=/path/to/perl5/lib/perl5
 HICF_SCRIPT_CONFIG=/path/to/etc/cron.conf

 # set the email address to which output (mainly error messages) should be sent
 MAILTO='path-help@sanger.ac.uk'

 # run the script every hour, on the hour

 #m  h   dom mon dow   command
 0   *   *   *   *     /path/to/bin/load_samples_cron

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script looks in a "dropbox" directory for assembly files to load into the
HICF sample metadata repository. Once a file is loaded it is moved into an
archive directory tree. If loading fails for any reason, the file is moved to
the "failed" directory and a message is printed. Configure the cron email
address to send the errors to an appropriate address.

No attempt is made to validate the contents of the files, but the filenames are
checked to make sure they have the right format. See
L<Bio::HICF::Schema::SampleLoader>.

=head2 CONFIGURATION

The script is configured by an Apache-style configuration file, specified
by an environment variable C<$HICF_SCRIPT_CONFIG>. The file should look like
this:

 <database>
   # perl DBI DSN
   connect_info dbi:mysql:host=dbhost;port=3306;dbname;database=hicf
   connect_info username
   connect_info password
 </database>
 <storage>
   # all three directories are required
   dropbox /nfs/hicf/data/storage/dropbox
   archive /nfs/hicf/data/storage/archive
   failed  /nfs/hicf/data/storage/failed
 </storage>
